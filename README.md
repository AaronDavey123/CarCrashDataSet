# CarCrashDataSet

## 📄 Description

This project analyzes car crash data from Seaborn's built-in dataset, car_crashes. The goal is to explore patterns and correlations in the data, such as the relationship between speeding, alcohol consumption, and crash totals. The project uses Python for data analysis and visualization with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.


## 📊 Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Renamed columns for better readability.
  - Checked for null values to ensure data quality.
- **Descriptive Statistics:**
  - Provided summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, min, and max.
- **Insights:**
  - Identified states with the highest insurance premiums and crash totals.
- **Visualizations:**
  - Bar graphs, scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to represent the data.
- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Heatmap to highlight relationships between variables.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

**Python:** Programming language used for analysis.
**NumPy:** Numerical computations.
**Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
**Seaborn:** Statistical data visualization.
**Matplotlib:** Plot customization and creation.
